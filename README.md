# EWA-EDL
Emotion Wheel Attention based Emotion Distribution Learning
Emotion distribution learning is an effective multi-emotion analysis model proposed in recent years. Its core idea is to record the expression degree of examples on each emotion through emotion distribution, which is suitable for handling emotion analysis tasks with emotional ambiguity. To solve the problem that the prior knowledge of emotion psychology is seldom considered in the existing emotion distribution learning methods, we propose an Emotional Wheel Attention based Emotion Distribution Learning (EWA-EDL) model. EWA-EDL generates a prior emotional distribution describing the relevance of emotional psychology for each basic emotion, and then directly integrates the prior knowledge based on the emotional wheel into the deep neural network through the attention mechanism. The deep network of EWA-EDL is trained using an end-to-end approach to learn both emotion distribution prediction and emotion classification tasks. The EWA-EDL architecture includes five main parts: input layer, convolutional layer, pooling layer, attention layer and multi-task loss layer. Extensive comparative experiments on 8 commonly used textual sentiment datasets show that EWA-EDL outperforms the comparison emotion distribution learning methods on both emotion distribution prediction and emotion classification task.
